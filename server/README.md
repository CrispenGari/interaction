## Node Backend

A backend boiler plate for a node backend with default express configurations.

### Getting started

Run

```
npx @crispengari/node-backend
```

### Then

```
yarn dev or npm dev
```

If typescript for hot reloading run the following commands in different terminals or command prompt

1. cmd 1

```
yarn watch
```

2. cmd 2

```
yarn dev
```

3. Or you can use a single command which:
   This command is built basically uses [ts-node-dev](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ts-node-dev). You can configure flags based on your preferences

```
yarn|npm start:fast
```

All done **Happy hacking**.
